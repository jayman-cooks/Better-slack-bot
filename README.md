<h1> Better Plane Slack Integration	</h1> 	
<p> One of the immediate weaknesses I saw within Plane project management(https://github.com/makeplane/plane) was the lack of a good notification system.

However, the custimization features were extremely lacking, as the slack bot reported on all activity(which would not be checked regularly by team members). To combat this, I have created a more customizable Slack bot.  </p>
