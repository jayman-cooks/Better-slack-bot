<h1> Better Plane Slack Integration	</h1> 	
<p> One of the immediate weaknesses I saw within [Plane project management](https://github.com/makeplane/plane) was the lack of a good notification system. I quickly turned to the Slack integration, thinking it would allow for more efficient communication. However, the custimization features were extremely lacking, as the slack bot reported on all activity(which would not be checked regularly by team members). To combat this, I have created a more customizable Slack bot.  </p>
<h3> Features </h3>
Currently, the program does not loop continuosly. Still a big work in progress!
